# STGameLauncher
 A Winforms app that launches Sonic games and their related programs on PC.
 
 Supports launching mod loaders for games that have them, and emulators for games that use them.
 
 To play a game, go into "Game Settings", enable that game, and set its location on your file system (when applicable).
 
 For games with emulators, you must first set the location for whichever emulator you use in Game Settings > Programs, the same goes for mod loaders and your Steam folder.
